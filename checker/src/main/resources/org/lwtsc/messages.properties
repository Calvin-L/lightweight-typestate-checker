lwtsc.invariant.unstable.array=Unstable invariant: elements of this array must always be in %s, but due to aliasing they may transition to %s
lwtsc.invariant.unstable.field=Unstable invariant: values for this field must always be in %s, but due to aliasing they may transition to %s
lwtsc.invariant.unstable.typeargument=Unstable invariant: generic type cannot be instantiated with %s, because due to aliasing instances in that state can transition to %s
